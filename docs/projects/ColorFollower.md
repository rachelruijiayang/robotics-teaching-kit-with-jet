# Color Following Robot

## Overview


The goal of this project is to program Jet to move all of the colored balloons into their respective goals.  Each robot will have 1 minute to score as many balloons as possible.

## Requirements

When Jet sees a sample of a certain color, it turns until the color sample is centered in the image, as in Figure&nbsp;\ref{color_follower_turning}.  When the color sample is centered in the field of view, Jet will drive towards the color sample, as in Figure&nbsp;\ref{color_follower_moving}.
